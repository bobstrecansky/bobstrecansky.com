Tonight I concocted a spicy andouille chicken sausage over white rice and steamed, raw honey glazed carrots.  This worked as a combination better than I thought it would.  The spicy from the chicken sausage, the slight sweet from the raw honey, and the buttery smooth rice worked nicely together.  I'll certainly be making this again in the future!
