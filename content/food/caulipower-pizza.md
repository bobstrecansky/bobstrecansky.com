My wife is a huge pizza fan. I’ve been trying to not eat like a jerk, so we’ve found that cauliflower pizza can often be a good middle ground for both of us. It’s healthy, it tastes 75% as good as pizza, and it helps me to avoid the [dad bod](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Dad%20bod).

We tried out [Caulipower’s Veggie Pizza](https://eatcaulipower.com/products/veggie-pizza) tonight.  We added prosciutto, just to take the vegetarian edge off.

The verdict? Pretty decent tasting. You’d never 100% mistake it for pizza, but it’s a decent low calorie, low carb dinner (that’ll leave you hungry 30 minutes after consuming it).
