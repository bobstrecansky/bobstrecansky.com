My wife likes steak.  It's been her favorite meal since she was little.  I thought I should treat her to her favorite dinner on a Friday night (It's been fun to cook a little bit more during our self-quarantine).  I've been attempting to perfect my sous vide fillet, and I'm getting pretty proud of it.  The secret ingredient to a fillet (in my wife's eyes) is [Dale's Seasonsing](https://www.dalesseasoning.com/), which is proclaimed on their website to be the "#1 Marinade in the Nation!".  I think my wife would agree.

I have been trying to watch a couple cooking instructional videos lately (thanks Youtube for the recommendation engine), and I've been paying attention on how to sear fatty meat - It seems to be helpful to render some of the fat from the steak by searing the steak on the fat first, followed by searing as you normally would (cast iron, hot pan, both sides).

I made some thyme roasted potatoes to go along with the meal, and my wife made the [Ambitious Kithcen Sesame Asparagus](https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/sesame-garlic-roasted-asparagus/).

This meal turned out great.  There is truly nothing better than a medium rare fillet and all the accoutrements that go alongside it.  The addage `Steak & Potatoes` rings true with me.

We washed it down with some [Slim Chillers](https://www.liquor.com/articles/slim-chillers-freeze-pops-costco/) alcoholic freeze pops, which liquor.com mentions are `an adult version of the freezer pops you probably loved as a kidâ€”except its version is full of vodka.`  They are truly delicious (and dangerous!)
