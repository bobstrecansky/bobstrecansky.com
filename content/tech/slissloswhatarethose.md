A friend of mine [Ravi Lachhman](https://twitter.com/ravilach) asked me to write a blog post for his company's new blog - [deliver-better.com](https://www.deliver-better.com/).  I told him I'd be happy to, as SLIs and SLOs are one of my favorite topics to discuss at work.

This blog post was fun to write, as I have been a consumer of alertmanager, but I had actually never written an alertmanager service definition from scratch before.  I also learned about Grafana's new [Provisioning Definitions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/provisioning/)
SLIs and SLOs add a ton of business value - I've seen them shine light on services and processes that were previously unmonitored.  Used in the correct way, they can help propel your business objctives forward!
