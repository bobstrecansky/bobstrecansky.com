### Bob’s Injury Avoidance / General Health Plan

#### Diet
* Try and eat a lot of foods from the Anti-inflammatory diet. These include:
  * Olive oil
  * Berries
  * Green vegetables
  * Legumes
  * Nuts (the Costco fancy mixed nuts are my favorite)
  * Fiber (I’ve considered taking a fiber supplement, but I believe I get more than enough fiber in my diet from the foods I
  eat.)
* Avoid simple sugars and processed foods when possible.
* I’m interested in the impact of Nightshade vegetable avoidance. I love tomatoes and peppers, so I think that may be something that’d be difficult for me. Drink 1 gallon of water a day.
This has made a measurable difference for me. 
* Attempt to only drink the following things:
  * Water
  * Coffee
  * Tea (Black, Green, Herbal)
  * Alcohol in Moderation
  * Sugar free sports drinks in moderation during intense exercise 
  * Sugar free energy drinks in moderation if exhausted. I often question how much these help me vs. hurt me. 
  * Nuun tablets in water
* Focus mostly on vegetables and lean meats (I have a weakness for red meat, but I’m attempting to cut back on it constantly).

#### Medicines / Vitamins
* Avoid NSAIDs unless absolutely necessary. This is subjective, but I feel the more we can avoid
them, the better off our body is at naturally suppressing the pain.
* Keep a constant regimen of vitamins. Current vitamins that I take daily:
  * Multivitamin
  * Green Tea Extract
  * B12
  * C
  * D
  * Zinc
  * Fish Oil
  * COQ10
* Don’t take any recreational drugs (never have been interested in them)
* Attempt to limit alcohol consumption (this can often be socially difficult)

#### Fitness
* Try to get at least 45 minutes of exercise daily. This can be anything from walking, to stretching, to tennis.
* Lots of stretching!  Stretch whenever you have a free moment. 
* Don’t do strenuous exercise when your body is yelling at you Don’t be a baby - get off the couch and go do something!

#### Ergonomics
* Sleep in a good bed.  We invested in [Sleep Number](https://www.sleepnumber.com/) bed, and I think it's worth its 
* weight in gold.
* Sit in a good chair at work, with good posture.  I got a [Herman Miller Embody](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/) at an awesome discount from work, but I don't think it needs to be that fancy.
* Keep your computer and monitors elevated above eye level to avoid strain.
* I've experimented with a standing desk, but I find it annoying for long periods of time.  I probably just need to keep the habit up.
* I've been experimenting with an [Advantage Kinesis Keyboard](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/) over the pandemic.  It took forever to get used to, but 
I love it now.

#### Sleep
* Try and get restful sleep!  I aim for 8 hours daily.  This is difficult with a young child.
* Try and follow the same sleep pattern if possible.  I usually aim for 11PM EST to 7AM EST, but this can often be shifted based on social norms.
* Attempt to not use screens for roughly a half an hour to an hour before bed.  This can be very difficult.
* Keep your electronics out of your bedroom (I charge my cell phone in my master bathroom so that it doesn't 
* interrupt me while I'm asleep, except for when getting paged during an oncall shift if needed.)

#### Recovery
* Foam rolling - Roll out your problem areas.  Lay on the foam roller in whatever problem area that ails you.  Find the spot where it really hurts, and lay on it for 1 minute.  It'll hurt incredibly bad during that time, but overall it helps immensely.
* Massage gun - The massage gun is wonderful for bumping out knots and other things.  I use mine roughly 3-5 times a week.
* Chiropractic - seeing a chiropractor at a regular cadence has helped my wellbeing immensely.
* Graston technique - Graston technique has helped a lot of sore muscles recover quickly (mostly for tennis elbow!)
* Cryotherapy - I've found cryotherapy to be unbelievably helpful
* Massages - I believe massages would be helpful for me if I had them at a given cadence, but I haven't invested the time or mooney into making it a normal practice for me.
* Hot tub - Hot tubs can be a very good relax mechanism!
