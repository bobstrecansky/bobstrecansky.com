      <description>A friend of mine works as a chiropractor and asked me if he could help maintain his company website. Normally I would decline this kind of engagement, as I find it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to mix business with friendship. He is a close friend and a tennis doubles partner, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d help him out. It was a simple wordpress site after all! :)
Modern wordpress is much different then I remember it being the last time I worked with it.</description>
