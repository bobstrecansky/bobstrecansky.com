      <description>My wife likes steak. It&amp;rsquo;s been her favorite meal since she was little. I thought I should treat her to her favorite dinner on a Friday night (It&amp;rsquo;s been fun to cook a little bit more during our self-quarantine). I&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to perfect my sous vide fillet, and I&amp;rsquo;m getting pretty proud of it. The secret ingredient to a fillet (in my wife&amp;rsquo;s eyes) is Dale&amp;rsquo;s Seasonsing, which is proclaimed on their website to be the &amp;ldquo;#1 Marinade in the Nation!</description>
