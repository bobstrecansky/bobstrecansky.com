      <description>Tonight I concocted a spicy andouille chicken sausage over white rice and steamed, raw honey glazed carrots. This worked as a combination better than I thought it would. The spicy from the chicken sausage, the slight sweet from the raw honey, and the buttery smooth rice worked nicely together. I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly be making this again in the future!</description>
