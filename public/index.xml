      <description>Tonight I concocted a spicy andouille chicken sausage over white rice and steamed, raw honey glazed carrots. This worked as a combination better than I thought it would.

The verdict?</description>

      <description>I wanted to be able to see my NGINX logs for this blog in JSON format, because I&amp;rsquo;m not sure were I&amp;rsquo;d like to eventually put them (perhaps Elasticsearch.
