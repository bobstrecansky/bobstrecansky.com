      <title>Modern Wordpress</title>

      <description>A friend of mine works as a chiropractor and asked me if he could help maintain his company website. Normally I would decline this kind of engagement, as I find it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to mix business with friendship. He is a close friend and a tennis doubles partner, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d help him out. It was a simple wordpress site after all! :)
Modern wordpress is much different then I remember it being the last time I worked with it.</description>

      <title>Microtime</title>

      <description>I spent a lot of time tracking down a bug in some PHP microtime code today. When reading microtime, one would think that it is time with microsecond precision. It often has more precision than that. It is also critical to remember that microtime() returns an int, and microtime(true) returns a float
php &amp;gt; echo(microtime()); 0.97812200 1588045939 php &amp;gt; echo(microtime(true)); 1588045944.5691 php &amp;gt; php also introduced hrtime() in PHP 7.3, which is a better option for a monotonic clock.</description>

      <description>A friend of mine Ravi Lachhman asked me to write a blog post for his company&amp;rsquo;s new blog - deliver-better.com. I told him I&amp;rsquo;d be happy to, as SLIs and SLOs are one of my favorite topics to discuss at work. You can see this blog post here
This blog post was fun to write, as I have been a consumer of alertmanager, but I had actually never written an alertmanager service definition from scratch before.</description>

      <description>My wife likes steak. It&amp;rsquo;s been her favorite meal since she was little. I thought I should treat her to her favorite dinner on a Friday night (It&amp;rsquo;s been fun to cook a little bit more during our self-quarantine). I&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to perfect my sous vide fillet, and I&amp;rsquo;m getting pretty proud of it. The secret ingredient to a fillet (in my wife&amp;rsquo;s eyes) is Dale&amp;rsquo;s Seasonsing, which is proclaimed on their website to be the &amp;ldquo;#1 Marinade in the Nation!</description>

      <title>Spicy Chicken Sausage</title>

      <description>Tonight I concocted a spicy andouille chicken sausage over white rice and steamed, raw honey glazed carrots. This worked as a combination better than I thought it would. The spicy from the chicken sausage, the slight sweet from the raw honey, and the buttery smooth rice worked nicely together. I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly be making this again in the future!</description>

      <title>Caulipower Pizza</title>

      <description>My wife is a huge pizza fan. I’ve been trying to not eat like a jerk, so we’ve found that cauliflower pizza can often be a good middle ground for both of us. It’s healthy, it tastes 75% as good as pizza, and it helps me to avoid the dad bod.
We tried out Caulipower’s Veggie Pizza tonight. We added prosciutto, just to take the vegetarian edge off.
The verdict?</description>

      <description>I wanted to be able to see my NGINX logs for this blog in JSON format, because I&amp;rsquo;m not sure were I&amp;rsquo;d like to eventually put them (perhaps Elasticsearch. It&amp;rsquo;s also really nice to be able to read and grok logs quickly with jq. I decided that this was easy enough to add in my logging. In my nginx.conf (typically stored at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf in most linux distributions, you just need to change the default log location to be something similar to this:</description>
