      <description>My wife likes steak. It&amp;rsquo;s been her favorite meal since she was little. I thought I should treat her to her favorite dinner on a Friday night (It&amp;rsquo;s been fun to cook a little bit more during our self-quarantine). I&amp;rsquo;ve been attempting to perfect my sous vide fillet, and I&amp;rsquo;m getting pretty proud of it. The secret ingredient to a fillet (in my wife&amp;rsquo;s eyes) is Dale&amp;rsquo;s Seasonsing, which is proclaimed on their website to be the &amp;ldquo;#1 Marinade in the Nation!</description>

      <description>Tonight I concocted a spicy andouille chicken sausage over white rice and steamed, raw honey glazed carrots. This worked as a combination better than I thought it would. The spicy from the chicken sausage, the slight sweet from the raw honey, and the buttery smooth rice worked nicely together. I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly be making this again in the future!</description>

      <description>My wife is a huge pizza fan. I’ve been trying to not eat like a jerk, so we’ve found that cauliflower pizza can often be a good middle ground for both of us. It’s healthy, it tastes 75% as good as pizza, and it helps me to avoid the dad bod.
We tried out Caulipower’s Veggie Pizza tonight. We added prosciutto, just to take the vegetarian edge off.
The verdict?</description>

      <description>I wanted to be able to see my NGINX logs for this blog in JSON format, because I&amp;rsquo;m not sure were I&amp;rsquo;d like to eventually put them (perhaps Elasticsearch. It&amp;rsquo;s also really nice to be able to read and grok logs quickly with jq. I decided that this was easy enough to add in my logging. In my nginx.conf (typically stored at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf in most linux distributions, you just need to change the default log location to be something similar to this:</description>
