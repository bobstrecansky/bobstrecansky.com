      <description>Tonight I concocted a spicy andouille chicken sausage over white rice and steamed, raw honey glazed carrots. This worked as a combination better than I thought it would. The spicy from the chicken sausage, the slight sweet from the raw honey, and the buttery smooth rice worked nicely together. I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly be making this again in the future!</description>

      <description>My wife is a huge pizza fan. I’ve been trying to not eat like a jerk, so we’ve found that cauliflower pizza can often be a good middle ground for both of us. It’s healthy, it tastes 75% as good as pizza, and it helps me to avoid the dad bod.
We tried out Caulipower’s Veggie Pizza tonight. We added prosciutto, just to take the vegetarian edge off.
The verdict?</description>
