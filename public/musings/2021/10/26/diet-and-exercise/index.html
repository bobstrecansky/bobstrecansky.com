                <h3 id="bobs-injury-avoidance--general-health-plan">Bob‚Äôs Injury Avoidance / General Health Plan</h3>
<h4 id="diet">Diet</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try and eat a lot of foods from the Anti-inflammatory diet. These include:
<ul>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Berries</li>
<li>Green vegetables</li>
<li>Legumes</li>
<li>Nuts (the Costco fancy mixed nuts are my favorite)</li>
<li>Fiber (I‚Äôve considered taking a fiber supplement, but I believe I get more than enough fiber in my diet from the foods I
eat.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid simple sugars and processed foods when possible.</li>
<li>I‚Äôm interested in the impact of Nightshade vegetable avoidance. I love tomatoes and peppers, so I think that may be something that‚Äôd be difficult for me. Drink 1 gallon of water a day.
This has made a measurable difference for me.</li>
<li>Attempt to only drink the following things:
<ul>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Tea (Black, Green, Herbal)</li>
<li>Alcohol in Moderation</li>
<li>Sugar free sports drinks in moderation during intense exercise</li>
<li>Sugar free energy drinks in moderation if exhausted. I often question how much these help me vs. hurt me.</li>
<li>Nuun tablets in water</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus mostly on vegetables and lean meats (I have a weakness for red meat, but I‚Äôm attempting to cut back on it constantly).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="medicines--vitamins">Medicines / Vitamins</h4>
<ul>
<li>Avoid NSAIDs unless absolutely necessary. This is subjective, but I feel the more we can avoid
them, the better off our body is at naturally suppressing the pain.</li>
<li>Keep a constant regimen of vitamins. Current vitamins that I take daily:
<ul>
<li>Multivitamin</li>
<li>Green Tea Extract</li>
<li>B12</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>D</li>
<li>Zinc</li>
<li>Fish Oil</li>
<li>COQ10</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt take any recreational drugs (never have been interested in them)</li>
<li>Attempt to limit alcohol consumption (this can often be socially difficult)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fitness">Fitness</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to get at least 45 minutes of exercise daily. This can be anything from walking, to stretching, to tennis.</li>
<li>Lots of stretching!  Stretch whenever you have a free moment.</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt do strenuous exercise when your body is yelling at you Don‚Äôt be a baby - get off the couch and go do something!</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ergonomics">Ergonomics</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sleep in a good bed.  We invested in <a href="https://www.sleepnumber.com/">Sleep Number</a> bed, and I think it&rsquo;s worth its</li>
<li>weight in gold.</li>
<li>Sit in a good chair at work, with good posture.  I got a <a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/">Herman Miller Embody</a> at an awesome discount from work, but I don&rsquo;t think it needs to be that fancy.</li>
<li>Keep your computer and monitors elevated above eye level to avoid strain.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve experimented with a standing desk, but I find it annoying for long periods of time.  I probably just need to keep the habit up.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with an <a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Advantage Kinesis Keyboard</a> over the pandemic.  It took forever to get used to, but
I love it now.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sleep">Sleep</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try and get restful sleep!  I aim for 8 hours daily.  This is difficult with a young child.</li>
<li>Try and follow the same sleep pattern if possible.  I usually aim for 11PM EST to 7AM EST, but this can often be shifted based on social norms.</li>
<li>Attempt to not use screens for roughly a half an hour to an hour before bed.  This can be very difficult.</li>
<li>Keep your electronics out of your bedroom (I charge my cell phone in my master bathroom so that it doesn&rsquo;t</li>
<li>interrupt me while I&rsquo;m asleep, except for when getting paged during an oncall shift if needed.)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recovery">Recovery</h4>
<ul>
<li>Foam rolling - Roll out your problem areas.  Lay on the foam roller in whatever problem area that ails you.  Find the spot where it really hurts, and lay on it for 1 minute.  It&rsquo;ll hurt incredibly bad during that time, but overall it helps immensely.</li>
<li>Massage gun - The massage gun is wonderful for bumping out knots and other things.  I use mine roughly 3-5 times a week.</li>
<li>Chiropractic - seeing a chiropractor at a regular cadence has helped my wellbeing immensely.</li>
<li>Graston technique - Graston technique has helped a lot of sore muscles recover quickly (mostly for tennis elbow!)</li>
<li>Cryotherapy - I&rsquo;ve found cryotherapy to be unbelievably helpful</li>
<li>Massages - I believe massages would be helpful for me if I had them at a given cadence, but I haven&rsquo;t invested the time or mooney into making it a normal practice for me.</li>
<li>Hot tub - Hot tubs can be a very good relax mechanism!</li>
</ul>
